# Reducer Configuration

1. When an action is triggered, all reducers will be called. To avoid this, in the reducers, we add a 'switch' to call a reducer when a specific action has been triggered; 
2. The reducer receives 'state' and the 'action' triggered as parameters. Whenever an a action has been triggered and listened, redux notifies all components that are obtaining data from that reducer that listened a action; 
```javascript
export default function cart(state = [], action) { // 2 
  switch(action.type) { // 1
    case 'ADD_TO_CART':
      return [...state, action.product];
    default:
      return state;
  }
}
```
