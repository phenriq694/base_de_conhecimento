# Web Scraping with Nodejs

1. Before creating a web scraper application, ALWAYS look if the websites has a public API, or make reverse engineer to find the API that this website uses. 
2. If there is no API, try to use 'Request' module before using some automated processor solution, if the goal is only parse HTML from a URL, the 'Request' module will be fine.
